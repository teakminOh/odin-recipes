        <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong> Vanilla extract enhances the flavor of the banana pudding.</li>
        <li><strong>Frozen whipped topping:</strong> Fold frozen whipped topping (such as Cool Whip) into the pudding mixture for a rich, fluffy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla wafers:</strong> Vanilla wafers add more flavor and welcome crunch.</li>
        <li><strong>Bananas:</strong> Of course, you'll need bananas! Slice them up just before you assemble the pudding.</li>
